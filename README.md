# Figma-To-Code
This is my first time of turing a figma design into codes. I saw the design on Facebook and i decided to code it. Although it's not 100% perfect but it's a responsive design.

This is just a way of putting myself to test and i guess i have passed that. Below is the picture of the figma design.
